What is Talons?
===============

Talons == [Falcon](http://github.com/racker/falcon) hooks.

Talons is a library of WSGI middleware that is designed to work with
the [Falcon](http://github.com/racker/falcon) lightweight Python framework
for building RESTful APIs. Like Falcon, Talons aims to be fast, light, and
flexible.

The first middleware in Talons is authentication middleware, enabling one
or more backend identity plugins to handle authentication.
